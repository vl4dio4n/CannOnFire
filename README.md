## Object Oriented Programming Project

### About
This is an OOP project for a course at Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of University of Bucharest. It's an C++ game built with the help of SFML library. The goal of the game is to shoot in some falling balls and increase your score without being hit by any of them (that is the moment you loose). 

### Good to know
- the cannons's controllers are &larr; and &rarr;
- in order to shoot keep the the `space` key pressed
